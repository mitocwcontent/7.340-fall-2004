  caption: "Ubiquitin is a small 76 amino-acid protein which is evolutionarily highly\
    \ conserved in eukaryotic cells. Ubiquitination of proteasomal substrate proteins\
    \ is performed by a complex system consisting of ubiquitin activating (E1) enzymes,\
    \ ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes and substrate recognition proteins (E3 enzymes).\
